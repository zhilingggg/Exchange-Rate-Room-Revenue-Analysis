# Exchange-Rate-Room-Revenue-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project investigates whether exchange rates can effectively predict hotel room revenue using time series forecasting models. Through comprehensive analysis using SARIMA and SARIMAX models, we examine the predictive power of USD/SGD exchange rates on hotel room revenue.
## Key Findings
* SARIMA and SARIMAX models produced identical coefficients and AIC values
* Exchange rates do not significantly improve room revenue prediction
* Adding exchange rate as an exogenous variable provides no additional forecasting value
